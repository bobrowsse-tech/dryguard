# Locks down main (and master, if it exists) on a freshly created DryGuard
# repo so that, even though the project is open source:
#   - the default branch can never be deleted
#   - all changes land only via reviewed pull requests (no direct pushes,
#     including by admins)
#   - only the maintainer(s) listed below may open pull requests against it
#     (everyone else can fork and the maintainer cherry-picks/merges, which
#     is the standard low-trust-contributor model for a young OSS project)
#
# Requires: GitHub CLI (`gh`), authenticated with a token that has `repo`
# and `admin:org` (if this is an org repo) scopes on the target repository.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh <owner>/<repo> [maintainer-login ...]
#
# Example:
#   ./scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh bobrowsse-tech/dryguard bobrowsse-tech
